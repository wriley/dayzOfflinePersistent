# dayzOfflinePersistent

Saves your character and gear plus enables beards (no shaving yet) for DayZ 0.63 stress test offline mode

This is a rudimentary system on a stress test build. Don't assume anything will work. Your milk will curdle, your car won't start, heck even your dog will probably suffer.

Instructions:

1) backup Missions\dayzOffline.ChernarusPlus\init.c

2) Replace with init.c from this repo

Caveats:

Magazine quantity is not saved so they will always be full when you load in

Item positions in your inventory are not saved. Look at your feet when loading in for extra things that wouldn't fit
